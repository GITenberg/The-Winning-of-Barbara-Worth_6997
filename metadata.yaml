description: Barbara Worth, the adopted daughter of a benevolent capitalist, dreams
  of turning California's Imperial Valley into a fertile land. Her dream goes awry
  when the reclamation is begun by a corporation which cares only for profit, and
  not for safety. During her battle with greedy land barons, she falls in love with
  a young engineer from the East.
